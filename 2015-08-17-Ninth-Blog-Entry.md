#Ninth Blog Entry

I am writing this week's blog at the beginning of the week (Sunday morning, actually).  This will be one more thing to check off the 'to do' list and free up my time for other projects.  I want to make sure that I have a blog submitted early so that I can devote my attention this week to my porfolio website and learning more JQuery, for example.  ]

I am really loving creating things (pages from scratch) with html and css.  It is exciting to see how pages--almost magically-- render, sometimes even with just tiny changes in the source code.  I feel a little like a kid, wide-eyed and in awe of something and surprised myself with something I made.  Yep, I did that all by myself.  I did so much code experimentation (adding every possible fancy code idea, trick and thing I came across) that I finally decided on the design and feel of my page (the opposite of all the flashy things I played around with.) I started over.  Clear.  Simple.  To the point.  The process of getting there was fun, though.  I still have lots to polish and bugFixing to do.  I need things to be more clear in my mind, but I have no doubt that I will get there.  Plus, I now know that I will enjoy learning, doing and getting there.  Now that things are all starting to come together more, I enjoy this course more each day.  

This leads me to believe that I will be quite happy working in this.  Working with computers, creative work, and design combined with web development is all fun for me.  (The infamous) "they" say that people should choose a career in something they love and they will never 'work' a day.  Makes sense.  When I taught a class in wildlife ecology at UW-Madison, I loved it.  It was like I couldn't get enough.  I had fun teaching and learned as much from my students (insights, questions, etc) as I taught them.  I feel like when I start and internship, and after, I will feel the same as I did about teaching.  I am excited to see.  It seems like a good idea to get paid as my career to do something I enjoy doing anyway.  (I think my next blog will be about the many reasons why working in this field is such a great match for me.)  We are going to "create something cool" using JQuery and this *cool JQuery thing* is due by this Wednesday. JQuery is very new to us, so this should be interesting.  However, *all* of these computer languages were new to me as we learned them, so I expect this will be similar to those.  I'll go with the flow and make it happen (although what I will make happen is not yet clear to me).  If I have time, I may revisit this blog to add an addendum about the JQuery project, after it is complete.  I'm intrigued anyway. 

I find that while I am doing assignments and work on topics (JavaScript, CSS, etc.), I tend to actually "get it" and understand it better about a week after we finish.  Although I did the worksheets, I understood Chapter 02 of the Eloquent JavaScript textbook much better *after* we completed *Chapter 03.*  Chapter 04 will make more sense when I complete Chapter 05, and so on. So, while I am working on something, I don't fully understand it.  I remember being totally confused by some things about command line that now seem second nature because I use them every day.  I remind myself that practice makes this much more clear and that I often learn this type of material best by doing. After using the new info in various contexts, I grasp it more.  I finally 'git' more of the git commands now. <--I also dig cheesy puns--after I buried them because they were so bad. I find it fun and gouda to play with words--especially now, since I have insomnia.  Sometimes I am easily amused by punny nonsense.  Should I go continue?  No.  Like most of this semester, I should get some much-needed sleep.)

 Since I have logged over 100 hours outside the class.  I logged these hours to keep perfect attendence, despite needing to miss classes due to my child having surgery and to learn more about subjects that interested me.  Since we only had a very brief survey of a few topics that piqued my interest, I learned more about those independently.  For example, I believe I spent about 30 hours outside of class just diving deeper into design principles, web design, best practices, color theory and other topics that I felt were important and interesting to me.  I enjoy learning, so I am sure I will continue learning more about these and more.  I also learned that I will still have access to some of the online programs, school and readings even after the class ends.  That is exciting to me as I would like to independently learn some other computer languages and expand on (or review) what I have already learned.  This summer *bootcamp* semester is extremely intense.  We cover a tremendous amount of material in a short time.  Although I am generally doing well in the class, I intend to review all material once I have a chance.  I want to clarify, in my mind, several things that were not completely clear (e.g., with JavaScript).  I would also like to learn more advanced JavaScript and CSS, Ruby and Python, just to mention a few.
