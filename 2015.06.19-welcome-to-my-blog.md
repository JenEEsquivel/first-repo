##Welcome. 
This is my first blog entry.  I am Jennifer E Esquivel--a student at the YWeb Academy and this is the last day of week one.  I can't believe how much we have learned in such a short time.
I will add to my blog weekly. This first one is short.

Actually, I need to fix this blog as somehow I have two copies and the one I just spent lots of time on is mia.
