##Hello Again

The second week of YWeb Academy was fun.  *Actually fun.*  Now, I am getting more familiar with the material, so it is going more smoothly.  This week we covered lots of material and I felt a sense of accomplishment when the week was through.  I studied lots at home and worked on extra work.  I am trying to get a rounded sense of all that is web development so that when I work somewhere, I have an idea of what is a good match for me, my skills and interests.  I learn quickly, so gaining new skills shouldn't be an issue.  

I got my Master's degree from UW-Madison while having a new baby, working a state job and being a teaching assitant for an upper level class.  I attended seminars until I gave birth and was back in seminar two days after.I am not sure how I did all of that; but having done it, I know I can accomplish anything.  YWeb is intense, but I have good time management skills and dedication.  I am sure I will do great in YWeb as well.
