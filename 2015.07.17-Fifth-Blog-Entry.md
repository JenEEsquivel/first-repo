As the fifth week ends, we are approaching the halfway point in class.  This program is challenging as we are learning lots of material, at a rapid pace.  However the format of the class makes it so that each week material from past weeks becomes clearer as we build upon what we have learned.  I am doing lots of work outside of class and learning additional information beyond what we are learning in class.  I have several dozen hours learning about the elements of design, design principles, and color theory, for example.  I intend to continue education outside of class to learn more about topics that interest me or topics I need to review to know them well.
